# Learning to redisocver tomography

I know nothing about Radon transforms beyond the name, and the vague
idea of how tomography works, piecing together the original structure
from scans through it. However, it's always fascinated me, and since
having a CAT scan for the first time a few months ago, the idea's
returned to me:

*Wouldn't it be interesting to implement this, and create my own tool
that can bcak out a structure from scans?*

My initial thought was that I'd read up on the maths, and implement
it. However, it seems more fun to try to work it out for myself, and
then check my workings afterwards, so this is what I intend to do
here.

## TODO

Everything!
